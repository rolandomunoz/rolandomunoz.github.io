  <h1>Finder v2.0.0</h1>
  <p> This plug-in <b>searches</b> for those <b>intervals</b> or <b>points</b> in your TextGrid files that contain a <b>specific label</b>. When a search is done, you can view the results in the <a href = "http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/TextGridEditor.html">TextGridEditor</a>. Also, you can extract those matched parts and save them as new files. More advanced users can use scripts to do other tasks.</p>
  
  <p>In this tutorial, I will show you  how to use this plug-in.</p> 

  <h2> Getting started</h2>  
  <h3>How to use it?</h3>
  
  <p>Follow these three steps in order:</p>
  
  <h4>1. Create an index</h4>
  
  <p>Go to <b>Create index...</b> in the <b>Do</b> menu. In the dialogue box, complete the <b>TextGrid folder</b> field with the path where your TextGrid files are stored. Then, click on <b>Ok</b> or <b>Apply</b>. By doing so, Finder will collect all the labels from the point and interval tiers of your TextGrid files.<br>
  
  When the process is done, Praat will print a summary in the Info window. It will show you all the tiers from your TextGrids and the sum of their labels. Tiers which does not have any label (in the TextGrids) will not be included in this report.<br>
  
  Adionally, you will see an index Table in the Object window. This table is only  for informative purposes. Feel free to remove it.
  </p> 
  
  <h4>2. Search a text</h4>
  <p>  Now, use the <b>Search</b> command of the main menu to look for specific labels in your TextGrid files.<br>
  In the dialogue box, pick the tier level on which your search will be done. Then, complete the <b>Search for</b> and <b>Mode</b> fields. For example, if you want to match all the labels that start with "a" in a specific tier, complete the <b>Search for</b> with the label "a" and pick the <b>starts with</b> mode. Then press in <b>Ok</b> or <b>Apply</b>.<br>
  At the end, Praat will report the results in the Info window. You will see the <b>Total number of occurrences</b> and, if your search is possitive, a list with non-duplicated labels called <b>Search Summary</b>.
  </p>
  
  <h4>3. Do something</h4>
  <p>Once a search is done, you can do some tasks.</p>
  <h4>3.1 View and Edit files</h4>
  At the end, 
  <h4>3.2 Extract files</h4>
  <h4>3.3 Use scripts</h4>
